        <h2>PC Gaming</h2>

        <p>
          Hello and welcome to my dedicated hobby webpage. In this section I'll
          share with you my story, the spark that ignited my love for PC Gaming,
          and why I believe you might love it too.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was the year 1999 was when I first dove into the world of PC gaming
          with a strategy game called Pharaoh. I'd already played video games on
          a Sega Genesis before, but the world of PC gaming was a revelation,
          opening up new posibilities of interaction and engagement.
        </p>

        <p>
          After Pharaoh, I dove headlong into The Sims, Half-Life, and the then
          popular mod for Half-Life, Counter-Strike Version 1.0. My gaming
          journey has since spanned decades, featuring hundreds, possibly
          thousands, of gaming titles. Fast forward to the present, my current
          most played titles are CS:GO 2.0, Overwatch 2, Valorant, and Chivalry
          2.
        </p>

        <p>
          Contrasting console gaming, PC gaming gives the user freedom that is
          both limitless and dangerous. This leaves lots of room for error, but
          it's perfect for those of us with an innate desire to probe, tinker,
          and occasionally break things. This intriguing blend of freedom and
          complexity might not appeal to everyone, but if you're someone who
          thrives on exploration and challenges, then PC gaming could be for
          you.

        <h2>Streaming</h2>
        <p>
          Streaming on Twitch is a unique digital experience that combines
          interactive entertainment, community building, and live broadcasting.
          Essentially, it's about sharing live video content, typically
          gameplay, with viewers from around the world. As a Twitch streamer,
          you're not just playing games; you're also interacting with your
          audience in real-time, responding to chat, taking suggestions, and
          even sharing aspects of your everyday life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Streaming is also not just about gaming. Twitch is a platform where
          streamers can broadcast a variety of content, including creative arts,
          music performances, coding sessions, or simply just chatting with
          viewers. While the platform was originally designed for gamers, it has
          since expanded to a broader audience, with channels dedicated to a
          variety of hobbies and interests.
        </p>

        <p>
          What sets Twitch apart is the sense of community it fosters. It's not
          just a one-way street; viewers interact with streamers and each other
          through live chat, creating a vibrant, dynamic environment. The more
          you stream, the more you engage, the stronger this community grows.
          Streaming on Twitch is an interactive, engaging, and communal
          experience. Whether you're a streamer or a viewer, there's always
          something new to discover, learn, and share.

        <h2>My Favorite Games</h2>
        <p>My current gaming obsessions are: Chivalry 2 and Valorant.</p>

        <p>
          Chivalry 2 is the kind of game that hits you with a rush of
          adrenaline. It's a medieval warfare game, but it's not just about
          swinging swords and storming castles. Every match is a riot of chaos
          and fun. One moment you're charging into battle, the next you're
          running for your life from a large group of enemies. It's raw, it's
          intense, and it's hilariously unpredictable. The skill ceiling for
          this particular game is pretty high and you won't be very good until
          at least 100 hours played.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the other side of the spectrum is Valorant. It's a strategic,
          team-based shooter that keeps you on your toes. Every round is a
          careful dance of tactics, skill, and teamwork. Whether you're the
          sniper hanging back, or the front-liner making a risky play, every
          decision counts. It's the kind of game that keeps you coming back,
          trying to perfect your skills and outsmart your opponents. It's a mind
          game as much as a shooting game, and that's why I love it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Two very different games, but both my current obsessions. If you
          haven't checked them out yet, check out the links at the top of this
          page for more information.

        <h2>PC Requirements for Gaming</h2>
        <p>
          If you're thinking about diving into the world of PC gaming, you'll
          need to consider your hardware. PC requirements can vary greatly based
          on the type of games you're interested in, but here's a basic rundown
          to get you started.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the heart of your PC is the processor or CPU. For casual gaming,
          something like an modern Intel i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 should do the trick.
          If you're leaning towards more graphic-intensive games or plan on
          multitasking with streaming or video editing, you might want to look
          at an i7 or Ryzen 7.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your graphics card or GPU is crucial for gaming. A mid-range GPU like
          NVIDIA GTX 1660 or AMD Radeon RX 6600 is a good starting point. If
          you're aiming for high-end gaming with maxed out settings or VR,
          consider a GPU like the NVIDIA RTX 4070 or an AMD RX 6800 or higher.
        </p>

        <p>
          RAM is your PC's short-term memory. 8GB of RAM is the absolute minimum
          for gaming these days, but I'd recommend at least 16GB for a smooth
          experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          A Solid State Drive (SSD) is a must-have for faster loading times. A
          1TB SSD should be sufficient, but if you plan on downloading a lot of
          games, consider a 2TB+ SSD or adding a secondary SSD for extra
          storage. Stay away from old spinning Hard-Drives.
        </p>

        <p>
          Don't forget about a good monitor. Look for something with a refresh
          rate of at least 75Hz (165Hz+ if you play a lot of fast-paced games
          like Valorant) and a resolution that matches your GPU's capabilities.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lastly, you'll need a decent keyboard and mouse. It doesn't have to be
          anything flashy, just comfortable and responsive. I would recommend a
          simple mechanical keyboard and a gaming mouse with very low latency
          and a good sensor.
        </p>

        <p>
          Remember, PC gaming is about gradual upgrades. You don't need the best
          rig right off the bat. Start with what suits your needs and budget,
          then upgrade components over time as needed.

        <h2>Gear Required for Streaming</h2>
        <p>
          If you're thinking about the gear you need to get started with
          streaming, you're in the right place. For your base setup, refer to
          the PC gaming hardware guide I shared earlier - the same principles
          apply. But streaming needs a few extras.
        </p>

        <p>
          The star of your stream is going to be a solid microphone. Your
          viewers need to hear you clearly. It doesn't need to break the bank,
          but definitely don't skimp here. A USB condenser mic is a good
          starting point, and you'll want a pop filter to catch those pesky "p"
          and "b" sounds.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next up, consider a webcam. It adds a personal touch and viewers
          generally like to see the person behind the voice. A 720p webcam is
          workable, but a 1080p one offers a clearer image and isn't much more
          expensive.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lighting is often overlooked but can make a big difference. Good
          lighting will make your webcam feed look much better. Simple desk
          lamps can work, but adjustable LED panels or a ring light offer more
          control.
        </p>

        <p>
          Don't forget about your internet connection. Streaming requires a
          solid upload speed, aim for at least 35 Mbps for smooth 1080p
          streaming. I recommend just going with Gigabit, with this out of the
          way you won't have to worry about your internet again.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lastly, invest in comfortable and durable peripherals. Streaming
          sessions can be long, so a good keyboard, mouse, and chair can make a
          world of difference.
        </p>

        <p>
          Remember, you don't need to have all the top gear from day one. Start
          with what you can, then upgrade as you go.
